# employee-tracker

## Purpose:  This app was created to help input departments roles and employees into a exising mysql database using node and inquier to add the appropriate data.  This app can greatly reduce the
time it takes to add personnel and company informtaiton to a database, rather than doing so manually with programs like excel.  

## Installation instructions:  Users wishing to use this code must first install all of the appropriate modules using npm and then enter their password to connect the mysql database. Users with the code would then
enter the node server.js in the terminal to begin the inquier prompts on their end.  Users will then work through the prompts using inputs and selecting from choices using the arrow keys.  Once the user has
added a department, role or an employee, they will be directed to choose another prompt to repeat the process.  Once the information is entered, users will find the information now added to their mysql database.
